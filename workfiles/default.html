            <p>A little CSS can easily transform a single HTML element into a fullscreen animation without loading additional resources or require extra markup.</p>
            <p>That's right. Your lean semantic HTML doesn't need to be compromised. You don't need extra trips to the server. And don't worry about high resolution displays. CSS got you covered there too.</p>

            <h2 id="how">How CSS is awesome</h2>
            <p>Each HTML element is like a canvas to CSS. You can paint it with multiple background gradients. You can add box-shadows for a final touch. Heck, you can even animate it.</p>
            <p>And if you ever find yourself running out of canvas, CSS is kind enough to give you two extra pseudo elements for each element. That's three canvases for the price of one.</p>
